# FixMahGemfile

This gem provides a script that modifies the Gemfile and runs bundler in one step.  This
came about because I needed to regularly make local modifications to a shared project, but
didn't or couldn't push my locally needed changes upstream.

## Installation

    $ gem install fix_mah_gemfile
